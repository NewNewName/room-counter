# What is this?
This is where the HTML and stuff goes. That way, it's all in one place.

# But this isn't where Apache/Tomcat/XAMPP/whatever is looking for html!
That's OK- set up a symbolic link from where they are looking to here. That should make both JSP run from this code, and whatever you're using for hosting, happy.
